      This text sits inside the main element, which has
      <code>writing-mode: vertical-rl</code>. One question to ask would be when
      this text will wrap into another line? Hmmm....

      If a box establishing an orthogonal flow is either a block container or a
      multi-column container, for the case where the box’s inline size is auto.
      If column-count and column-width are both auto, use the shrink-to-fit
      formula min(max-content, max(min-content, constraint)). Constraint is the
      inline-axis size that would stretch fit into to the smallest of:
      <ul>
        <li>
          the available space: the containing block’s size if that is fixed,
          else the size represented by the containing block’s inner max size (if
          that is fixed) floored by its inner min size (if that is fixed)
        </li>
        <li>
          the nearest ancestor scrollport’s inner size if that is fixed, else /
          capped by its inner max size if that is fixed, floored by its inner
          min size if that is fixed
        </li>
        <li>the initial containing block’s size</li>
      </ul>
