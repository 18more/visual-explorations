    <h3>Three content-sized items</h3>
    <p>
      This stack has display: flex, which means its outer display is block, 
      so it fills the width of its enclosing container (body), and the height
      is calculated automatically to fit the content. <br /><br />
      Each stack (flex) item is a container with width 100%, and 
      max-width: max-content. This means every item asks for the same size
      (width: 100%), which means it has the same flex-basis, which means
      each item will get the same width. max-width: max-content ensures
      that if a flex item reaches its max-content size, 
      it stops shrinking.

    <h3>Two content-sized items with a resizable image between them</h3>
    <p>
      If a flex item is marked as resizable-horizontally, it also has a width
      of 100%, but it does not set a max-width, which means this item will
      be as big as allowed by the flex container. But it sets min-width to 8px
      so that it can shrink beyond the min-content of its content if needed.

    <h3>Two content-sized items with a spacer between them</h3>
    <p>
      Spacers are resizable items, but they have lower priority when it comes
      to taking up space. This means that regular content gets the space
      first, and if it clamps to max-content, then the Spacer gets
      whatâ€™s left. Spacers set a huge width or height on themselves,
      which causes the topmost stack to expand to fill the available
      space of its enclosing container. But because each stack item
      content element has a max-width of 100%, it will never overflow
      the space given to it by the flex item container.
