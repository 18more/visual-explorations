      >In Firefox, Chrome, and Edge, an ‘auto’-sized flex item stretched in the
      cross axis and with an aspect ratio will affect its flex base size, and
      effectively the main size of the container. In Safari, the stretched size
      isn’t taken into account and a content-based size seems to be
      used.</strong

          >The domestic dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris)[4] is a
          domesticated descendant of the wolf. The dog derived from an ancient,
          extinct wolf,[5][6] and the modern grey wolf is the dog's nearest
          living relative.[7] The dog was the first species to be
          domesticated,[8][7] by hunter–gatherers over 15,000 years ago,[6]
          before the development of agriculture.[1] Their long association with
          humans has led dogs to be uniquely adapted to human behavior,[9]
          leading to a large number of domestic individuals[10] and the ability
          to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other
          canids.</span
