      Used value of min size property used for:

      - Clamping the flex item flex base size when determining the flex item hypothetical main size.
      - Clamping the flex item target main size when resolving the flex item’s flexible length.
      - Clamping each non-frozen item’s target main size by its used min and max main sizes when resolving flexible lengths.

      Min size resolves differently depending on value.
      - auto min size resolves according to https://drafts.csswg.org/css-flexbox/#min-size-auto

      How to measure this:
      - Give flex container zero width or height (whichever measurement corresponds to the main size).
      - Give the flex item you’re measuring flex-shrink: 1000.
        - You could give it a 1, but any anonymous flex items will also have an unchangeable initial flex-shrink: 1. I’m not 100 % sure, but it could affect the shrinkage of our item of interest such that it stops shrinking before hitting its minimum size. So let’s force it to shrink at a vastly higher rate than the anonymous flex items.
      - Prevent other flex items from generating boxes altogether with display: none.
      - Measure the used width or height of the flex item.
        - Because the flex container has a main size of 0, the flex item will be forced to shrink all the way to 0. On the way there, it should hit its minimum size and clamp to that. Then its final size will be equal to its minimum size, and we can measure that.

      Updated measurement to account for percentages
      - Set flex container size to its used size.
      - Set flex-grow to 0.
      - Set flex-basis to 0.
      // - Set flex item flex-shrink to 1.

      Interaction with max size
      - auto min size gets clamped by max size

      Does max size clamp on min size when clamping the flex item target main size, or vice versa?
      The clamp() CSS function  resolves this way:
      max( MIN, min(VAL, MAX) )
      http://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp()
      https://drafts.csswg.org/css-values/#funcdef-clamp
      - let noGreaterThanMAX be the result of calling min(VAL, MAX)
      - let noLessThanMIN be the result of calling max(MIN, noGreaterThanMAX)
      - based on that, it seems that the min size value takes precedence.

      Min main size is dependent on
      - content (auto and intrinsic sizing)
      - max main size if definite (clamped by it if auto sizing)
      - containing block main size (if percentage specified size is used)

      Does setting flex-basis: 0, and thus base size to 0, affect flex container main size?
      - flex base size does affect hypothetical main size, hypo = clamp(used min, base, used max)
      - hypo affects flex line placement of flex items

      Does flex base size affect the size of the container?

      flex base size
      400 whatever
      50
      70
      40

      calc initial free space
      none of the items is frozen
      for not-frozen items, use outer flex base size
      414.18 + 56.43 + 74.6 + 60.45 = 605.66

      flex container inner main size
      311.483

      initial free space
      311.483 - 605.66 = -294.177
      abs(-294.177) = 294.177

      #1
      414.18 / 605.66 = 0.68384902
      unclamped target main size
      414.18 - 0.68384902 * 294.177 = 414.18 - 201.17265316 = 213.00734684
      clamped target main size
      clamp(used min, 213.00734684, used max) = clamp(120, 213.00734684, 120) = 120

      #2
      56.43 / 605.66 = 0.09317109
      unclamped target main size
      56.43 - 0.09317109 * 294.177 = 56.43 - 27.40879174 = 29.02120826
      clamped target main size
      clamp(56.43, 29.02120826, Infinity) = 56.43
