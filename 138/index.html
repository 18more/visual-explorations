      This text sits inside the main element, which has
      <code>writing-mode: vertical-rl</code>. One question to ask would be when
      this text will wrap into another line? Hmmm....

    <h2>Mr. Peanutbutter</h2>
    <aside>
      Mr. Peanutbutter is an energetic and cheerful yellow Labrador Retriever
      who is BoJack's former sitcom rival and Diane's ex-husband. Mr.
      Peanutbutter was the star of Mr. Peanutbutter's House, which, according to
      BoJack, "borrowed the premise" from Horsin' Around. It is revealed in the
      episode "See Mr. Peanutbutter Run" that the working title for Mr.
      Peanutbutter's House was Untitled Horsin' Around Knockoff. Mr.
      Peanutbutter portrays many characteristics of an actual Labrador,
      including a love for tennis balls, a hatred of the mail man, and suspicion
      of doorbells and is sweet, loyal, kind, playful, and considerate. His
      generally upbeat and affable personality is often contrasted with the
      show's other major characters, particularly Bojack and Dianne.
