- JavaScript stops executing once you’re in the Home screen
- for example, my console clearing interval didn’t execute (5000 ms)
- it did execute immediately after I opened Safari
- the interval does execute at 2000 ms, so it might be that Safari
gives you a couple of seconds to execute JavaScript once the app
has moved out of the foreground

Touch, drag, then press the Safari address bar

- your target keeps receiving events while you interact with
the Safari address bar and settings!
- the toolbar is disabled while you drag, though
