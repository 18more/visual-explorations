      <div class="box-2">Main: Box 2; Sleep is divided into two broad types: non-rapid eye movement (non-REM
        or NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Non-REM and REM sleep
        are so different that physiologists identify them as distinct behavioral
        states. Non-REM sleep occurs first and after a transitional period is
        called slow-wave sleep or deep sleep. During this phase, body
        temperature and heart rate fall, and the brain uses less energy.[7] REM
        sleep, also known as paradoxical sleep, represents a smaller portion of
        total sleep time. It is the main occasion for dreams (or nightmares),
        and is associated with desynchronized and fast brain waves, eye
        movements, loss of muscle tone,[2] and suspension of homeostasis.
      
        Awakening can mean the end of sleep, or simply a moment to survey the
        environment and readjust body position before falling back asleep.
        Sleepers typically awaken soon after the end of a REM phase or sometimes
        in the middle of REM. Internal circadian indicators, along with
        successful reduction of homeostatic sleep need, typically bring about
        awakening and the end of the sleep cycle.[16] Awakening involves
        heightened electrical activation in the brain, beginning with the
        thalamus and spreading throughout the cortex.</div>
