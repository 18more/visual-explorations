    <!-- Percentage margins and paddings on flex items, like those on block boxes, are resolved against the inline size of their containing block, e.g. left/right/top/bottom percentages all resolve against their containing block’s width in horizontal writing modes. -->

        background-color: #222;

    <main>
      Text inside a main element, which generates a block-level box that is a
      block container. Body element width: 400px. Main element padding: 10%.
      Percentages resolve against the inline size of the containing block. The
      inline size is always the inner inline size, regardless of the value of
      the containing block’s box-sizing.
